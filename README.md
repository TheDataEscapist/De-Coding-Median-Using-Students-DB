# Decoding-Median-using-Students-DB
### Situation:
Tasked with analyzing Math Test Scores for a students database, aimed at decoding the median score using advanced SQL techniques.

### Task:
Develop efficient methods to calculate the median score, ensuring accuracy and performance, applicable to all datasets.

### Action:
1. Implemented User-defined functions to set the base for median calculation.
2. Employed Common Table Expressions (CTE) for streamlined queries.
3. Defined Aliases for readability.
4. Utilized Window Functions to order scores in CTE.
5. Applied Aggregate Functions to summarize data.
6. Leveraged ROUND(), CEIL(), FLOOR() Functions for precision adjustments pertaining to even/odd number of observations.
7. Used the MOD() Function to check for even/odd dataset sizes.
8. Organized results with ORDER BY.
9. Filtered data using the IN Operator and LIMIT Clause.
10. Ensured data integrity with IS NOT NULL Operator.

### Result:
Successfully calculated median score with versatile, reusable logic, enhancing data analysis capabilities for various datasets.
